def reasons():
    return 'We knew that linear regression would be a good fit for this data because it is adept at predicting one simple target variable. Generally speaking, linear regression is best at providing clear insight into the impact that each feature has on one target variable, which offers easy interpretation to the relationship between the target and features. Additionally, it is a perfect choice of model when the goal is to predict a continuous target variable, which is exactly what we are trying to achieve with count, so linear regression was the best choice for our dataset.'
